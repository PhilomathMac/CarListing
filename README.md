## Description
CWC's September Community Challenge - a list of expandable cards showing car details decoded from JSON

## Goals

**Level 1 Requirements:**

* Show a simple list of collapsed items or cards
* Extract the list information from the join JSON file, or you can come up with your own assets
* Show a collapsed list that consists of the following:
  * Car Image
  * Name
  * Price
  * Rating

**Level 2 Requirements**

* Add or implement the expandable card to the list
* By default, the first item should be expanded
* Upon clicking or tapping an item, the previous item will collapse, and the new item will expand.
* Pros and cons sections should be shown.
* Note that there is no limit to the number of bullet points inside the card so these should be added and scaled dynamically.

**Level 3 Requirements**

* Implement the filters
* Add a filter section in the UI, such as:
* Vehicle make
* Vehicle model
* You can create the two filters list from the JSON provided or come up with your own
* Show the result in the dropdown
* The UI should be updated accordingly upon selecting a specific filter/s
